##### DESCRIPTION


The focus of this project was to detect lung cancer type using CT scan images, with the main objective being to determine the suitable image processing method for medical images when only a limited amount of training data is available. In the study, PET-CT DICOM images from TCIA platform is used. The project utilized the prototypical network which is well known few shot learning methods.

In prototypical network 4 different feature extraction methods were used.


- VGG16
- ResNet50
- DenseNet
- CNN



Under the implementation folder your can find out the source code for each feature extraction method.
